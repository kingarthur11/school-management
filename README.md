# Fourstrides Prototype Client Repository

Welcome to the Fourstrides company repository. This repository is home to our prototype client built with next js, which resides in the `client` folder.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm

### Installation

To set up the project for development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/fourstrides/prototype.client.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the client folder:

   ```bash
   cd prototype.client/client
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash

The application should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Client Folder

The `client` folder contains our Next.js application. We use **Shadcn UI** as our component library to build the UI efficiently and with a consistent style.

### Structure

Here's an overview of the folder structure within `client`:

- `shared-components/`: Reusable UI components built with Shadcn UI.
- `app/`: The application's app, following Next.js's file-based routing.
- `public/`: Static assets like images and fonts.
- `styles/`: Global styles and theme configurations for Shadcn UI.

## Shadcn UI Documentation

For detailed documentation on using Shadcn UI components in your projects, please refer to the [Shadcn UI Documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs). This will provide you with all the necessary information on how to implement and customize the components to fit the design requirements of our application.
